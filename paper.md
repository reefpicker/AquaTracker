# Summary

Acoustic telemetry has become an important tool in fisheries research.  Information from acoustic telemetry studies is used in fisheries science to define habitat ranges, migratory routes, foraging areas, home ranges, and to estimate survival of anadromous species at various points along their seaward migration. We developed a program, AquaTracker, to quantify, analyze, and visualize the data generated by steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in Puget Sound.  The program, AquaTracker, can plot a fish path as a graph or animate the path and export the animations as a movie.  The program can plot a valid path around land-masses.  AquaTracker can also calculate travel rate, distance, range, path linearity, and many other track parameters. Data quality control tools include tools to identify receivers with overlapping radii and a tool that identify singletons. The program was written in Visual Basic 6.0.
