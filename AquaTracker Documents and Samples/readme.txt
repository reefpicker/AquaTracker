AquaTracker Version 2.41R
by Jose J. Reyes-Tomassini
Release date: Apr 4, 2016
==========================

Thanks for downloading AquaTracker.  The following is a list of files that should have been installed by AquaTracker's Setup Pogram.

On the Program Files/AquaTracker or Program Files(x86)/Aquatracker:

1) Converter.exe: Program use to prepare acoustic detection files for import into AquaTracker (see the Manual)
2) Aquatracker.exe: Main AquaTracker application
3) unins000.exe: This program will remove AquaTracker and all its components from the computer
4) unins000.dat: Internal file used for the uninstaller program

On the desktop, a TWO folder shortcut should be created:

"AquaTracker Documents and Samples".  This folder contains:

1) v241_notes.pdf      : This document describes some of the changes and bugs found and fixed for THIS version of AquaTracker
2) v22_notes.pdf       : Bug fixes from version 1.0 to 2.20, only check if you are upgrading from version 2.0 or earlier
3) QuickStartGuide.pdf : This document offers a quick illustrated guide of the user interface and guided examples that showcase some of AquaTracker's features.
4) AT MANUAL v240.pdf  : This is the manual for AquaTracker and Converter.exe programs.  I suggest you print this out and read at least Chapter 1 and 2 if you have never used AquaTracker.  AquaTracker v2.3 has no on-line HELP, so this is your only real help! Keep it at-hand!
5) License.txt: Information regarding AquaTracker license and government disclaimer.
6) Readme.txt          : This file.

It also includes the following samples files.  YOU WILL BE USING THESE FOR THE TUTORIALS:

7) Sample_Detection_File_not_formatted.csv    : A sample detection file used in the illustrated guide
8) Sample_Detection_File_Old_ATFormat.csv     : A sample detection file which has no header tags.  Can be used with AquaTracker and also with the Converter program.
9) Sample_Detection_File_no_receiver_names.csv: A sample detection file with no receiver names to show the auto-naming of receivers feature within Converter.  Use with the Converter program only.
10) Sample_Detection_File.csv                 : Same as #6 but does not need to be converted first by AquaTracker's converter.exe program.
11) SampleMovie.avi                           : A short movie clip showcasing the ability of AquaTracker to create AVI files from its animations.  This sample is meant to show that such movies can be embeded into a PowerPoint-type presentation.
12) HC_Map.bmp                                : Map of Hood Canal in Puget Sound provided as a sample and to plot the data on the Sample Detection file.

"Video Tutorials".  This folder contains videos of the program running on a desktop, with step-by-step instructions on how to do certain things in AT
The tutorials are in the AVI format.  The following are the tutorials in the folder:

1) An overview of AT          : Not so much a tutorial but an overview of some of AquaTracker's features.  Watch first.
2) AQN files                  : A step-by-step and demonstration of how to create AQN files in AquaTracker
3) Density plots              : This tutorial shows you how to get density plots with AT and how to export them to a presentation
4) Distance based scatter plot: This step by step tutorial shows how to create distance-based heat maps and scatter plots
5) Georeferencing maps        : This tutorial shows you how to georeference the sample map included.  It also includes a short demo on Land-avoidance
6) Loading unformatted data   : Step-by-step tutorial on how to load data into AquaTracker using the converter program


I encourage you to explore the Sample Detection files provided and the tutorials.

Once more, thanks for downloading the program.  Enjoy your data exploration!
